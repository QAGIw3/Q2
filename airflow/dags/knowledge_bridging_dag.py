    ## Knowledge Bridging DAG

    This DAG periodically triggers the `knowledge_engineer` agent to process new documents.
    
    The agent will:
    1.  Fetch unprocessed documents from the vector store.
    2.  Extract structured entities and relationships.
    3.  Write the new information to the Knowledge Graph.
