# ðŸ§  managerQ

## Overview

`managerQ` is the control plane for the Q Platform's multi-agent system. It acts as a centralized dispatcher and coordinator, making the pool of autonomous `agentQ` workers a usable and scalable resource for the rest of the platform.

Its core responsibilities are:
-   **Agent Discovery**: Maintaining a real-time registry of all active and available `agentQ` instances.
-   **Task Dispatching**: Providing a single, unified API for other services to submit tasks to the agent pool.
-   **Load Balancing**: Distributing incoming tasks across available agents with the correct `personality`.
-   **Result Correlation**: Listening for results from agents and correlating them back to the original request.

## Architecture

`managerQ` is a FastAPI service that uses several background threads to manage its state and communicate over Pulsar.

1.  **`AgentRegistry`**: A background thread consumes from the `q.agentq.registrations` topic. When an `agentQ` instance starts, it publishes a registration message. The registry adds it to an in-memory list of active agents.

2.  **`TaskDispatcher`**: When a request comes into the API, the dispatcher gets an available agent from the registry (based on the requested `personality`) and publishes the task message directly to that agent's unique task topic.

3.  **`ResultListener`**: A second background thread consumes from the shared `q.agentq.results` topic. When it receives a result, it uses an `asyncio.Event` to notify the original API request handler that the task is complete.

4.  **API Layer**: The FastAPI application exposes two main endpoints:
    - `POST /v1/tasks`: Submits a new task to an agent. This endpoint returns a `task_id`.
    - `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}`: Retrieves the result of a task. This endpoint will block until the result is available or a timeout occurs.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

-   An running Apache Pulsar cluster.
-   At least one running `agentQ` instance.

### 2. Running the Service

The service can be run directly via Uvicorn for development.

```bash
# From the project root
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)

# Run the server
uvicorn managerQ.app.main:app --reload
```

The API documentation will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8003/docs`.
