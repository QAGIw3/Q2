# Q Platform Overview

The Q Platform is a distributed, highly-adaptive, and privacy-conscious AI ecosystem for real-time, multi-agent inference, decision-making, and collaborative learning. It aims to bridge human intent, LLMs, quantum optimization, and swarm intelligence at any scale.

## Core Components

- **H2M â€“ Human-to-LLM Translator:** The gateway for translating human intent to optimized LLM prompts.
- **QuantumPulse:** The distributed, real-time LLM inference and messaging platform, built on Apache Pulsar.
- **agentQ (QuantumPulse Agent):** An autonomous, quantum-optimized inference and decision engine.
- **managerQ (QuantumPulse Manager):** The orchestrator and swarm intelligence manager for distributed agents.
