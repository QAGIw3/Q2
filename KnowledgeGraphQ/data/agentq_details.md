# agentQ Details

agentQ is the core inference and decision-making component of the QuantumPulse ecosystem. It combines quantum-assisted optimization with real-time context management to deliver autonomous, adaptive, and ethically filtered responses across distributed environments.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Execute inference tasks without centralized orchestration.
- **Real-Time Adaptive Prompt Management**: Dynamically optimize and reformulate prompts based on intent and context.
- **Context Compression & Retrieval**: Efficiently compress conversation history and retrieve semantic context.
- **Quantum-Assisted Inference Optimization**: Leverage quantum reasoning to accelerate and refine inference operations.
- **Real-Time Ethical Filtering**: Enforce dynamic ethical and safety policies on outputs.
