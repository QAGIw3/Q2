```

## üîß Development Workflow

### Daily Development Commands

```bash
# Format your code
make format

# Run linting
make lint

# Run tests
make test

# Run all quality checks (what CI runs)
make dev-check

# Fix common issues automatically
make dev-fix
```

### Working with Services

Each service follows a consistent structure:
```
service_name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                   # Application code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                 # Service-specific tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile            # Container definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # Service documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.py             # Package setup
```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards:
   - Python: Follow PEP 8, use Black formatting (120 char line length)
   - Use type hints where possible
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   make dev-check  # Run all quality checks
   make test       # Run tests
   ```

4. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your descriptive commit message"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Structure
- **Unit tests**: `tests/unit/` - Fast, isolated tests
- **Integration tests**: `tests/integration/` - Cross-service tests
- **Service tests**: Each service has its own `tests/` directory

### Running Tests

```bash
make test              # Run all tests
make test-unit         # Unit tests only
make test-integration  # Integration tests only
make test-coverage     # Generate coverage report
```

### Writing Tests

- Use `pytest` for Python tests
- Follow the existing test patterns in each service
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Write integration tests for cross-service functionality

## üêõ Debugging

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Development Tools Not Found
```bash
# If you get "command not found" errors:
make setup-dev
```

#### Dependency Issues
```bash
# Clean and reinstall dependencies:
make clean
make install-deps
```

#### Docker Issues
```bash
# Clean Docker resources:
make clean-docker
docker system prune -a
```

### Debug Individual Services

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Run service with debugger
cd agentQ
python -m pdb -m agentQ.app.main
```

## üìö Documentation

### API Documentation
- Each service exposes OpenAPI/Swagger docs at `/docs`
- Visit `http://localhost:PORT/docs` when running services

### Service Documentation
- Each service has comprehensive README.md
- Architecture decisions are documented in ADRs (coming soon)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

### Pre-commit Hooks
Pre-commit hooks run automatically and include:
- Code formatting (Black, isort)
- Linting (flake8)
- Security scanning (bandit)
- YAML/JSON validation

### Security Scanning
```bash
make security-scan  # Run bandit security scanner
make deps-check     # Check for vulnerable dependencies
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
# Start full stack locally
docker-compose up -d

# Or start services individually
make serve-agentq
```

### Kubernetes Development
```bash
# Deploy to local K8s cluster
cd infra/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## üí° Tips and Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Run `make dev-fix` before committing to fix common issues
- Use the provided VS Code settings for consistent formatting
- Write descriptive commit messages following conventional commits

### Performance
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Profile code with `cProfile` for performance bottlenecks
- Monitor service metrics via Grafana dashboards

### Debugging
- Use structured logging with `structlog`
- Add correlation IDs for tracing requests across services
- Use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

## üÜò Getting Help

### Resources
- **Architecture docs**: Check individual service READMEs
- **API docs**: Visit `/docs` endpoint on each service
- **Issues**: Create GitHub issues for bugs/features
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions

### Common Patterns
- **Error handling**: Use shared error handling patterns in `shared/error_handling/`
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Configuration**: Use Pydantic models for config validation
- **Testing**: Follow pytest patterns in existing tests
